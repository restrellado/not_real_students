# Not Real Students 

This repository contains code I'm using to make a fake dataset for use in my upcoming book, **The K-12 Educator's Data Guidebook: Reimagining Practical Data Use in Schools.** 


## Scripts

*make_student_dataset.R:* Makes a fake student level dataset. This fake dataset is for an elementary school district with 10 schools.
