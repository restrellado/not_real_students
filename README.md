# Not Real Students 

This repository contains code I'm using to make a fake dataset for use in my upcoming book, *The K-12 Educator's Data Guidebook: Reimagining Practical Data Use in Schools.* 


## Scripts

**make_student_dataset.R:** Makes a fake student level dataset. This fake dataset is for an elementary school district with 10 schools.  

 - student_id: randomly generated unique student ID like the ones you'd find in school student systems

 - quiz_100: randomly generated quiz scores with a set mean and standard deviation 

 - quiz_cat: category of quiz scores performance
